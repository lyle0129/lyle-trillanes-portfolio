          I am a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of the Philippines Diliman, one of the most prestigious institutions in the country. My undergraduate studies equipped me with a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Organization and Embedded Systems, Computing Architectures, Instrumentation Electronics, and Digital Logic Design.
Throughout my degree, I developed a strong passion for Embedded Systems, which became the focus of my thesis and most of my projectsâ€”integrating both hardware and software to create efficient, real-world solutions.
Beyond academics, I have been a self-taught full-stack developer for the past two years, building scalable and user-focused web applications that reflect my drive to bridge the gap between low-level systems and high-level software design.
